- Each device has an "intervals" list.
- Each interval contains:
  - "start": ISO 8601 timestamp (e.g., "2025-06-02T00:00:00+02:00")
  - "end": ISO 8601 timestamp
  - "command": a string like "heat", "cool", "off", "sleep"
  - Optional: "power_kw": float, "energy_kwh": float
  - Optional: "source": either "ai" or "manual"

Create 24 intervals of 1 hour each for a device called "heat_pump", using the "heat" command throughout.

Respond only with JSON.
